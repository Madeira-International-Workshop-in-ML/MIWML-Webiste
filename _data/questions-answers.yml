- title: "Vision"
  content: "This workshop is designed to show the basic steps needed to start Machine Learning with Python. At the same time, it also serves for sharing the knowledge with a beginner by showing the steps and tools related to the field. <br><br> The planned sessions include both theoretical lectures as well as practical sessions, given by researchers with experience in Machine Learning applications."

- title: "Who is this event for?"
  content: "Basically, for researchers, students, industry practitioners and other people interested in the topic. You must, however,  have some knowledge of programming, with preferably hands-on experience in Python. No deep previous knowledge of Machine Learning is required; however, if you have some experience in the area, that’s even better."

- title: "What do I need to bring with me?"
  content: "Just bring a computer with the peripherals that you use on a normal day. We will ask you to have some software pre-installed on your computer for the workshop. This information will be sent to your email a few days before the workshop.<br><br>We will also provide you with a free wireless connection."

- title: "Language"
