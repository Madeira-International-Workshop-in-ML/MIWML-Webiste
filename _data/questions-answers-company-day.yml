  content: "The idea of organizing a company day started right at the end of the first Madeira International Workshop in Machine Learning. In the first edition of the MML, we had a company exhibition in the middle of the fourth day.
  <br><br>We understood, at that time, that companies showed a keen interest in having more time to share their products and services, and more time to perform in-local job interviews. As a result, we recognize that we must have a full day dedicated to companies, or as we named it, a <i>Company Day</i>."
